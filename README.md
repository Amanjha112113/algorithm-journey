# 🧠 Algorithm Journey – LeetCode Daily Progress 🚀

Welcome to my **Algorithm Journey**!  
This repository is a daily log of my commitment to solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) as I strengthen my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** and **problem-solving** skills.

## 📅 Daily Submissions

Each folder (`DAY-1`, `DAY-2`, etc.) contains:
- ✅ **Problem titles & numbers**
- 📸 **Screenshots** of accepted submissions
- 🧩 Focus areas: Dynamic Programming, Arrays, Strings, Math, Greedy, Graphs, etc.

## 🔥 Why I'm Doing This

- To stay consistent and accountable  
- To master algorithmic thinking  
- To prepare for coding interviews & AI/ML model integration  
- To track personal growth and milestones
